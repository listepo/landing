# The package registry

The registry is an ordinary GitHub repository. Every top-level folder is a
package, and holds one `ketch.toml` describing it:

```
ketch-registry/
├── README.md          ← not a package: no ketch.toml
├── fd/
│   └── ketch.toml
├── jq/
│   └── ketch.toml
└── ripgrep/
    └── ketch.toml
```

The folder name *is* the package name — it is what `ketch install <name>`
matches. There is no index file to keep in step with the contents, and a
folder without a `ketch.toml` is simply not a package, so the repository can
carry a README, a licence and CI config alongside the packages.

## A package file

```toml
# ripgrep/ketch.toml
source      = "github:BurntSushi/ripgrep"
description = "Recursively search directories for a regex pattern"
homepage    = "https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"
bin         = [{ name = "rg" }]
provides    = ["rg"]
```

`source` is the only required field. The rest are the same fields a user
manifest in `~/.ketch/manifests/` takes — [MANIFESTS.md](MANIFESTS.md) is the
full schema, and `src/builtin.toml` is a working example of each.

`name` may be given, but it must equal the folder name — a package that
disagrees with its folder would be unreachable under the name the folder
advertises, so ketch refuses it rather than quietly indexing it twice.

## What ketch checks

A registry entry is code someone else wrote that ends up creating files on a
stranger's disk, so it is checked before it is trusted:

| Refused | Why |
| --- | --- |
| an unknown key (`binary = …` for `bin = …`) | a misspelt key that is silently ignored installs the wrong thing and complains nowhere |
| a `local:` source | a registry entry must name a release anyone can fetch, not a path on one machine's disk |
| `name` that disagrees with the folder | the package would be unreachable under the name its folder advertises |
| a `name` or `bin.name` that is not a usable file name | `name` becomes a directory in the store and `bin.name` a link in `~/.ketch/bin`; `../../.zshrc` is not a binary |
| a `bin.path` or `extra_paths` entry containing `..` | paths are relative to the extracted payload and must stay inside it |
| a `bin` entry with neither `name` nor `path` | it describes nothing to link |
| a `provides` entry with whitespace | nobody can type it |
| a `strip_prefix` above 8 | each level is a directory listing of the payload, and no real archive nests wrappers that deep |

A folder that fails is reported and skipped on a machine that already has the
registry, so one bad entry never takes the rest of the copy down with it.
`ketch update` also warns when two packages claim the same name — each folder
is valid alone, but only one of them would ever resolve. Clients stay
best-effort about an already-published registry: they warn and skip, they do
not refuse the whole tree.

Before merge, the same problems are fatal. `ketch registry validate` turns
parse errors, validation errors, and name or alias collisions into a failing
run so they cannot land.

[`Manifest::validate`](MANIFESTS.md) also applies to `~/.ketch/manifests/*.toml`.
Registry entries must additionally pass the `local:` and folder-name rules in
the table above — rules user manifests never see — so a manifest that installs
locally is not necessarily one that can be contributed as-is.

## Using it

```bash
ketch update             # fetch the registry into ~/.ketch/registry
ketch registry status    # age and source of the local copy; no network
ketch search fd          # search it, alongside GitHub
ketch install fd         # install by name
ketch doctor             # registry line includes package count, age, and revision
```

Nothing fetches the registry implicitly: a name that resolves today keeps
resolving offline tomorrow, and `ketch install owner/repo` never needs it at
all. `ketch update` is the only refresh. `ketch registry status` and `ketch
doctor` read the local copy and `registry.meta.toml` (source revision and
fetch time, stored under the ketch root beside the manifests) and never
open a network connection.

## Author and maintainer workflow

The exact validation command, run from the registry repository root (or any
tree laid out the same way):

```bash
ketch registry validate .
```

That is what must pass before merge: every `ketch.toml` parsed, checked
against its folder name, refused when `source` is `local:`, passed through
[`Manifest::validate`](MANIFESTS.md), with name and alias collisions failing
the run.

To also offline-install the entries a pull request changes, put one local
asset per package in a fixture directory — a file named after the package,
or a folder of that name holding exactly one file — and name the packages:

```bash
ketch registry validate . --fixture ./ci/fixtures --changed ripgrep --changed fd
```

Without `--changed`, every package that has a fixture is installed. `--changed`
without `--fixture` is an error. The install runs in a throwaway ketch root
from the fixture file, so a `github:` source in the entry never reaches the
network. A missing binary, a bad `bin.path`, or an archive that will not
unpack fails the same way as a collision.

### Compatibility

- **Local validation (`ketch registry validate`)** is fail-closed. Invalid or
  colliding entries fail the run, so they cannot be pushed upstream.
- **Clients** (`ketch update`, lookup, install by name) stay best-effort
  about an already-published bad registry: they warn, skip the broken folder,
  and keep resolving the rest. They never fetch as a side effect of status
  or doctor.
- A fixture install is extra proof for changed entries. It does not replace
  the tree-wide collision scan.

Registry CI was deliberately dropped (plan.md F2): the `ketch-registry`
repository removed its only workflow (commit `5a9bbd6`, "no CI is wanted in
this repo"), so there is no upstream workflow to land this in. Validate locally
before pushing, from the registry checkout root (or any tree laid out the same
way):

```bash
ketch registry validate .
```

Add the same check as a pre-push hook so nothing unvalidated leaves the
machine — from the registry checkout root:

```bash
cat > .git/hooks/pre-push <<'EOF'
#!/bin/sh
# Refuse the push when the registry tree would not validate.
ketch registry validate . || exit 1
EOF
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
```

`registry push` runs those same per-package checks on the file it is about to
send. It does not scan the rest of the registry for name collisions — only
`registry validate` does that. It does not offline-install against a fixture.

## Contributing a package

A `ketch.toml` at the root of a project is the same file its registry folder
would hold, so contributing it is one command, run from that root:

```bash
KETCH_GITHUB_TOKEN=... ketch registry push            # fetch, compare, then a pull request
ketch registry push --yes                             # answer the question in advance
ketch registry push --dry-run                         # what would be pushed, offline
ketch registry push --file path/to/ketch.toml         # a file somewhere else
ketch registry push --registry someone/their-registry # a registry other than the default
```

After the file passes, `registry push` fetches the registry's current copy
of `<name>/ketch.toml` from the registry's default branch, and what happens
next depends on what that holds:

| Registry's copy | What `registry push` does |
| --- | --- |
| does not exist | opens the pull request straight away |
| is byte for byte the same | reports `unchanged` and opens nothing |
| differs | prints a unified diff — its copy as the old side, the local file as the new — and opens the update pull request only after yes/no |

It then puts the file at `<name>/ketch.toml` on a branch called `ketch/<name>` and opens a pull
request against the registry's default branch. With push access to the
registry the branch is made there; without it, on a fork of the registry
under your account, created if needed. Pushing again updates the same branch,
and joins the pull request that is already open rather than opening a second.

`--yes` answers the question in advance — for scripts and CI, where there is
no one to ask, or for when you already know what the diff says. `--dry-run`
shows what would be pushed without touching the network.

`name` may be left out of the file, in which case the folder it sits in names
the package — the same rule the registry applies. The file goes up exactly as
written, comments included.

The token is the one every other command uses (`KETCH_GITHUB_TOKEN`, or
`github_token` in `config.toml`); it needs the `repo` scope, or for a
fine-grained token, contents and pull requests on the registry — and, if a
fork is involved, permission to create one.

## Precedence

A name is resolved against, in order:

1. `~/.ketch/manifests/<name>.toml` — your own manifests
2. the fetched registry
3. the registry compiled into the binary (`src/builtin.toml`)
4. inference from `owner/repo`

So a local manifest always wins, and a package curated in the registry beats
the older copy baked into whatever ketch build you happen to be running.

## Pointing at a different registry

```bash
export KETCH_REGISTRY=someone/their-registry
```

or in `~/.ketch/config.toml`:

```toml
registry = "someone/their-registry"
```

The default is `listepo/ketch-registry`. Only `owner/repo` is accepted; the
repository's default branch is what gets fetched.
