# Observability

cox emits `tracing` spans and events for every session, turn, provider
round and tool execution. They always land in a local JSON log; with
`telemetry.otel = true` they are also exported as OpenTelemetry traces and
logs over OTLP/HTTP to any compatible backend (SigNoz, Jaeger, Grafana
Tempo, Honeycomb, hosted collectors). There is no vendor SDK in the binary:
the standard `OTEL_*` environment variables are the whole portability
contract.

## Local logs (always on)

Every run appends JSON lines to `~/.cox/logs/cox.log.<date>` (under
`COX_HOME` when set), one line per event with the enclosing span ids, so a
failed run can be read without any backend. `core.log_level` is a `tracing`
filter string (`info`, `debug`, `cox_core=trace,info`).

## Turning on OTLP export

```toml
# ~/.cox/config.toml
[telemetry]
otel = true
# optional: where to send; empty means the OTEL_* variables decide
endpoint = "http://localhost:4318"
```

or, for one headless run: `COX_TELEMETRY_OTEL=true cox run -p "..."`.

Standard variables the exporter honours (the `opentelemetry-otlp` defaults):

| Variable | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | base URL; cox appends `/v1/traces` and `/v1/logs` | `http://localhost:4318` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT` | per-signal full URLs | derived from the base |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` | `key=value,key2=value2`, e.g. an API key for a hosted backend | none |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TIMEOUT` | export timeout in ms | `10000` |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | resource `service.name` | `cox` |
| `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` | extra resource attributes, `k=v,k2=v2` (`deployment.environment=dev,host.name=$HOST`) | none |
| `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT` | `true` records prompts, completions, tool arguments and tool output on spans | unset (off) |

`telemetry.endpoint` is a convenience for the first variable and overrides
it when both are set. `cox` needs the `otel` cargo feature (on by default);
a build without it fails at startup when `telemetry.otel` is true rather
than silently dropping data.

### Content capture is opt-in

By default spans carry operational metadata only: ids, models, token
counts, cost, latency, stop reasons, tool names, subjects, risk, byte
counts and outcomes. Prompts, completions, tool arguments and tool results
are recorded only when `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT`
is `true`, because they contain your source code and, sometimes, secrets
that a tool printed. Turn it on for a local stack, never for a shared
backend you do not control.

## What cox emits

### Spans

One session is one trace. Every turn hangs off the session span, and every
provider round and tool call hangs off its turn, so opening a trace shows the
whole agent loop in order.

| Span | Emitted for | Key attributes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `invoke_agent cox` | the session | `gen_ai.operation.name`, `gen_ai.agent.name`, `gen_ai.conversation.id`, `cox.session.id`, `cox.session.parent_id` (subagents), `cox.cwd` |
| `invoke_agent cox.turn` | one user turn | `cox.turn.id`, `cox.turn`, `cox.job`, `cox.tier`, `cox.turn.stop_reason` |
| `chat` | one provider round | `gen_ai.provider.name`, `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, `gen_ai.response.finish_reasons`, `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`, `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens`, `cox.usage.cache_read_tokens`, `cox.usage.cache_write_tokens`, `cox.usage.estimated`, `cox.cost.usd`, `cox.provider.call.ordinal`, `cox.retry.count` |
| `execute_tool` | one tool call | `gen_ai.tool.name`, `gen_ai.tool.call.id`, `cox.tool.subject`, `cox.tool.risk`, `cox.tool.duration_ms`, `cox.tool.output_bytes`, `cox.tool.success`, `cox.archive.id` |

A failed span sets `error.type` and `otel.status_code=ERROR`. `cox.archive.id`
is the id `cox expand <id>` takes, so a truncated tool result in a trace can
still be read in full locally.

### Content attributes (opt-in only)

These four are written only under
`OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT=true`:
`gen_ai.input.messages`, `gen_ai.output.messages`,
`gen_ai.tool.call.arguments` and `gen_ai.tool.call.result`. A contract test
asserts they are absent by default and present after the opt-in, so the
default cannot regress silently.

## Backends

Every backend below speaks OTLP/HTTP; only the endpoint and headers change.

**Local smoke stack (Collector + Jaeger + Grafana/Tempo).**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.telemetry.yml up -d
COX_TELEMETRY_OTEL=true OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318 \
  cox run -p "list the files in this repository"
open http://localhost:16686           # Jaeger: service "cox"
open http://localhost:3000/explore    # Grafana → Tempo → search service.name=cox
docker compose -f docker-compose.telemetry.yml logs otel-collector | grep -A3 LogRecord
docker compose -f docker-compose.telemetry.yml down -v
```

Host ports bind to loopback only: Grafana's anonymous admin access is for
local development, not a shared deployment. The collector receives on
4317/4318, fans traces out to Jaeger and Tempo
and prints log records to its own stdout; nothing is persisted after
`down -v`.

For a repeatable smoke run from this repository without an AI API key,
start the stack above, then run:

```bash
scratch=$(mktemp -d)
COX_HOME="$scratch" COX_PROVIDER=scripted \
  COX_SCENARIO="$PWD/crates/cox/tests/scenarios/write_then_done.toml" \
  COX_TELEMETRY_OTEL=true OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=cox-smoke \
  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318 \
  mise exec -- cargo run -p cox -- --no-hooks --no-mcp \
    --cwd "$scratch" --permission-mode auto run -p "write a test file"
```

The fixture writes only `$scratch/a.txt` and replies `done`. Allow a few
seconds for collector batching, then search for service `cox-smoke` in
Jaeger or Grafana. Expect a session, a turn, two `chat` spans and one
`execute_tool` span. The same trace ID is available in both backends.

**Jaeger alone** (v2 accepts OTLP directly):
`docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:16686:16686 -p 127.0.0.1:4318:4318 jaegertracing/jaeger:2.2.0`,
then the same `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318`.

**SigNoz** (self-hosted or cloud): point at the SigNoz collector,
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318` for the docker install,
or `https://ingest.<region>.signoz.cloud:443` with
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=signoz-ingestion-key=<key>` for cloud.

**Grafana Cloud / Tempo**: `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://otlp-gateway-<region>.grafana.net/otlp`
with `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=Authorization=Basic <base64 instance:token>`.

**Honeycomb, Maple and other hosted collectors**: the vendor's OTLP/HTTP
endpoint plus its API-key header, for example
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://api.honeycomb.io` and
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=x-honeycomb-team=<key>`.

## What the database records about a session

Traces are optional and expire; `~/.cox/cox.db` is the durable record and is
always written. Two tables describe a session, and no cost exists outside
them ("a cost that is not a `usage` row in the ledger does not exist").

`sessions` — one row per session, written at start and updated after every
finished turn:

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | ULID; also the rollout filename and the FTS key |
| `created_at` | **start time**, RFC 3339 UTC with milliseconds |
| `updated_at` | **end time**: the last finished turn. A session still running is indistinguishable from one that stopped — cox records when work last happened, not an intent to close |
| `cwd`, `project_slug` | where the session ran |
| `title` | generated summary, `NULL` until one exists |
| `parent_id` | the session that spawned this one (subagents) |
| `rollout_path` | the JSONL event log — the full transcript |
| `turns` | finished turns |
| `cost_usd` | sum of the session's `usage.cost_usd`, recomputed per turn |
| `state` | `open` \| `closed` \| `error` |

`usage` — one row per provider call, the ledger `cox stats` reads:

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `session_id`, `turn` | which session and turn paid for the call |
| `job` | `main`, `compact`, `summarize`, `memory`, … |
| `tier` | `cheap` \| `code` \| `think` — what the router was asked for |
| `provider`, `model` | what actually served it |
| `effort` | `low` \| `high` \| `xhigh` after clamping to what the model supports. `NULL` on rows written before this column existed — the ledger reports what it observed, never a default, and both `cox stats` and `cox sessions <id>` print such a row as `-` |
| `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_read_tokens`, `cache_write_tokens` | **tokens**, as the provider reported them |
| `context_tokens` | what the model saw on this call (the context-token-turns metric) |
| `estimated` | the model had no price row: costed 0 rather than dropped |
| `cost_usd`, `latency_ms` | what the call cost and how long it took |
| `created_at` | when the call was recorded |

Reading them back:

```bash
cox sessions                 # every session: id, title, cwd, age, turns, cost
cox sessions <id>            # one session: start, end, duration, turns, cost,
                             # then tokens per provider/model/effort
cox sessions <id> --json     # the same record, machine-readable
cox stats --session <id>     # per-call rows, then tier/job totals and top tools
cox stats --day --csv        # the ledger grouped by day
```

`archive` (tool output by id, read with `cox expand <id>`) and `memory` are
the other two tables; they are per-call and per-project rather than per-session.

## Reading a trace

A session is one trace; open it and you see the turn, under it one span per
provider round with the model, token counts and cost, alongside the tool
calls with their subjects, durations and outcomes. Errors mark the span
status. Provider completion, retry and tool completion logs can be correlated
with those spans; the rollout remains the complete source for TUI events.
