# Design: WASM plugins (A52, phase P33)

## Problem

v0.1 extends cox through data and processes: markdown, hook subprocesses and MCP servers (`extensions.md`). The creator has decided that v0.2 adds an in-process WASM host (extism). With it, one package can contribute hooks, tools, event listeners, TUI parts (status segments, panels, commands and keys, custom rendering), model providers, catalog rows, MCP servers and answers to the core's typed questions. No new cox release is needed for any of that.

The measurable question: can one plugin package add a status segment, a hook, a deferred tool and a provider, while

- §1.15 invariants 1, 8 and 10 (`prefix_bytes_identical_between_turns`, `every_request_has_a_usage_row`, `broken_hook_is_skipped_not_fatal`) stay green, and
- each enabled plugin adds at most 50 ms to a warm session start and 5 ms p95 to a render?

## The field

- **Zellij (R§4.3.5 P18–P19).** WASM plugins `subscribe` to event types and ask for permissions through `request_permission`, over 14 kinds; the answer arrives as an event. `update(Event) -> bool` decides whether `render(rows, cols)` runs. There is no render per frame. cox takes this redraw model as is.
- **Zed (P20).** An `extension.toml` manifest and Rust built for `wasm32-wasip2`. Capabilities such as `process:exec` and `download_file` are declared in the manifest, and the user narrows them with `granted_extension_capabilities`. cox takes the "declared in the manifest, narrowed by the user" shape. Zed still reaches agent tools through MCP.
- **Claude Code (P21, `extensions.md`).** "Plugins" are bundles of markdown, hooks, `.mcp.json` and `bin/`, with nothing in process. cox already reads all of those formats (D4). A cox plugin adds only what a bundle cannot do: in-process code with a typed ABI.
- **extism 1.30.0 (P1–P17).** Wasmtime 43 underneath. The host controls `allowed_hosts`, `allowed_paths` (preopens, `ro:` for read-only), `memory.max_pages`, `timeout_ms` and `config`. It also has host functions with `UserData`, a `CancelHandle` that works from another thread, and a SHA-256 check on module bytes. `Plugin` is `Send + Sync`, but `call` takes `&mut self`. The error type is anyhow. HTTP and file loading are default features that cox turns off.

## Decision

1. **One host crate owns extism.** `cox-plugin` holds extism with `default-features = false`, so there is no `ureq`, no URL loading and no file loading (P5). It depends on `cox-protocol`, `cox-plugin-api` and `cox-sanitize`, and implements the protocol traits (`Hook`, `Tool`, `Provider`, `EventTap`, `Advisor`).
2. **The core does not know plugins exist.** `cox-core` sees plugins only through traits in `cox-protocol` (D2), and `crates/cox` wires everything together.
3. **Plugin runs are recorded as ordinary events.** Everything a plugin does to a session appears as an event already in the rollout: a hook outcome, a tool result, provider events, a notice, or the new `Advised`. Replaying a session without the plugin therefore gives the same log (D12).
4. **Approval is per digest.** A plugin runs only under a grant that names its package digest and its capabilities. Changed bytes or wider capabilities ask again.
5. **Plugins get no new trust path.** Every tool call a plugin makes passes `cox_core::permission::Engine`. Every path passes `confine`, every process runs under `sandbox::Policy`, and every string that reaches the terminal passes `cox_sanitize`. No host function goes around any of these.
6. **Plugins fail open (D14).** A trap, a timeout or a malformed reply is a `Notice(Warn)` and an absence. Three failures in a row disable that export for the session, and `cox doctor` and `cox ext` report it.

## 1. Package, discovery and commands

A plugin is a directory. Its id is `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,23}$` with no `__`.

```text
<id>/
  plugin.toml          manifest (§2)
  plugin.wasm          the module the manifest names
  bin/…                optional: executables an [[mcp]] entry names (§7c)
  README.md            optional
```

Locations:

- **User plugins** live in `~/.cox/plugins/<id>/versions/<digest12>/`. A `current` file names the active version, and at most one `previous` is kept (§1b).
- **Project plugins** live in `<git root>/.cox/plugins/<id>/` and are read in place.

If both locations have the same id, the user plugin wins and the project plugin is skipped with a notice. A repository must not shadow code the user installed.

**Project plugins are repository content, and repository content is untrusted (D14).** A project plugin never loads until the user enables it for that repository with `cox plugin enable <id> --project` or the TUI dialog. That grant is keyed on the plugin id, the repository root and the digest. This mirrors how a project `.mcp.json` must be approved. Cloning a repository never runs its plugins.

**Digest.** SHA-256 over the whole package tree: `(relative path, length, bytes)` for every file, sorted by path. It covers the manifest, the wasm and any `bin/` executable, so swapping a shipped MCP binary cannot avoid a new approval. `sha2` is already a dependency of `cox`, `cox-store` and `cox-provider`.

**CLI.** A new `cox plugin` group, because `cox ext` today has only `list` (`crates/cox/src/cli.rs:311-325`, `ext_cmd.rs:16,61`). `cox ext list` gains a *plugins* section so one command still lists every extension.

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `cox plugin list [--json]` | discovered plugins, source, version, digest, grant state, disabled exports |
| `cox plugin install <dir>` | validate (§2), copy into `versions/<digest12>/`, record the source, then run `enable`'s approval |
| `cox plugin enable <id> [--project] [--yes]` | show the capabilities in words and ask. `--yes` is for a user's own provisioning script |
| `cox plugin disable <id>` | clear `enabled` on the grant row; files and data stay |
| `cox plugin update [<id>… \| --all] [--check] [--rollback]` | §1b |
| `cox plugin remove <id> [--keep-data] [--yes]` | §1c |
| `cox plugin new <name> [--lang …] [--dir …] [--with …]` | §13 |

The global switch is `plugins.enabled`, as a config key, an env var and `--no-plugins` (D13).

**Install sources in v1: a local directory only.** Fewer is better:

- a local path needs no network, no download UX and no trust-on-first-download;
- it is enough for the dev loop (`new` → build → `install` or `link`) and for every test;
- a URL with a pinned `sha256` and a git tag are listed in §12 as out of scope.

`install` records `{kind: "path", path, digest}`, and `update` re-reads that path.

### 1b. Update and rollback

`cox plugin update <id>` steps:

1. Re-read the recorded source.
2. Validate the manifest against the schema and the `api` version.
3. Compute the digest. If it equals `current`, stop and print "up to date".
4. Compute the capability diff against the stored grant.
5. `--check` prints steps 3–4 and changes nothing.
6. Otherwise, write the new tree to `versions/<new12>/.tmp`, fsync it, and rename it to `versions/<new12>/`.
7. Ask for a grant, showing the capability diff with added capabilities highlighted and removed ones listed. This covers both "bytes changed" and "widened".
8. Only after approval, write `current` (temp file plus rename, which is atomic on one filesystem). The old version becomes `previous`, and older versions are deleted.

Headless and ACP never approve. Given a widening or a new digest, they keep `current` and print `Notice(Warn)`: "update for <id> waits for approval: run `cox plugin update <id>`".

`--rollback` swaps `current` and `previous`. Grants are stored per `(id, scope, digest)` (§3), so the previous grant is still valid unless it was revoked. If it was revoked, the rollback asks again.

**A running session never picks up an update.** Tool schemas are in the cache-stable prefix. The new version loads at the next session, or at `/plugin reload`, which is the same as `/clear`: a new session in the same cwd, with a notice that the cache prefix starts over.

### 1c. Remove

`cox plugin remove <id>` steps:

1. Ask for confirmation (TUI modal or stdin; `--yes` skips it).
2. Disable the grant, so a concurrent session no longer loads the plugin at its next open.
3. Delete `~/.cox/plugins/<id>/` recursively after checking that the resolved path is inside `~/.cox/plugins/`. It never follows a symlink out of that path.
4. Delete every grant row for the id.
5. Delete the plugin's kv rows unless `--keep-data` is given.
6. Report config that still references the plugin, and edit none of it: `[plugins.<id>]`, a `tiers.*.provider` naming one of its provider sections, `[plugins.decide]` entries, and `keybindings.toml` rows for `plugin.<id>.*`.

In the current TUI session, `/plugin remove` stops the instance, so UI, hooks and events stop at once. Its tools stay in the frozen prefix but answer `ToolError::Denied { why: "plugin removed" }` until the next session. A project plugin's files belong to the repository, so for one, `remove` revokes the grant and deletes kv, and prints the path for the user to delete with git.

`/plugin new|update|remove|reload|list` in the TUI palette go through `Cmd` to the same `crates/cox` module the CLI uses. There is no second implementation.

## 2. Manifest `plugin.toml`

The types live in `cox-plugin-api::manifest` (§9). The committed schema is `docs/plugin.schema.json`, generated with `schemars::schema_for!`. Its drift test copies the protocol-schema test (`crates/cox-protocol/src/lib.rs:65-81`). One module in `cox-plugin` owns loading and validation (AGENTS "Config files").

```toml
api = 1                          # ABI major; the host refuses a different major
id = "git-glance"
version = "0.3.0"
name = "Git glance"
description = "Branch and CI state in the status line"
wasm = "plugin.wasm"
wasi = false                     # true for wasip1 guests (Go); no preopens unless [capabilities.fs]

[limits]                         # shown at approval; the host clamps to its maxima
memory_mib = 16                  # → max_pages; host max 64
call_ms = 200                    # default per-call budget; per-kind caps in §5–§8 are tighter

[capabilities]
events   = ["turn_started", "tool_call_done", "usage"]   # Event serde tags
hooks    = ["PreToolUse", "PostToolUse"]                 # HookEvent names
tools    = ["summarise"]                                 # become wasm__git-glance__summarise
invoke   = ["read", "grep"]                              # tools the plugin may call (each still passes Engine)
context  = true                                          # the event-folded context snapshot
kv       = true
model    = "cheap"                                       # cox_model_call tier ceiling; "code" must be named; never "think"
net      = ["api.github.com"]                            # allow-list for cox_http
fs       = { read = ["$WORKSPACE"], write = [] }         # WASI preopens, each through confine
decide   = ["risk"]                                      # §6b decision points
ui       = { status = true, panel = true, overlay = false, commands = true, keys = true, render = ["tool:wasm__git-glance__summarise"] }

[[provider]]                     # §7a
name = "typesafe"                # plugin id stays "jev"; the section is named "typesafe" (§14 decision 13)
api = "plugin"                   # "chat" | "responses" | "plugin"
base_url = "https://api.typesafe.ai"
api_key_env = "TYPESAFE_API_KEY"
auth = "bearer"                  # "bearer" | "x-api-key" | "none"

[[models]]                       # §7b
id = "jev-latest"
provider = "typesafe"
context_window = 64000           # 64k/request, 32k for state + longest question (R§4.3.6 J6)
price = { input = 0.042, output = 0.0 }

[[mcp]]                          # §7c
name = "gh"
command = "bin/gh-mcp-${target}" # inside the package, or a PATH program shown verbatim at approval
args = ["--stdio"]
```

Validation (T33.1 and T33.4):

- `id` matches the directory name;
- every name fits the model tool-name rule `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}` after prefixing;
- `net` entries are host patterns, not URLs;
- `fs` roots are `$WORKSPACE`, `$PLUGIN_DATA` or paths inside them;
- a `ui.render` target outside the plugin's own tools needs an explicit `tool:<name>`, which approval shows as "changes how <name> looks";
- unknown keys are an error. The manifest is ours, so `deny_unknown_fields` applies, as in `Config` (`crates/cox-protocol/src/config.rs:35`).

The capability list is the unit of approval. Each entry becomes one line in the dialog, for example "Can call the model on the cheap tier (costs appear in `cox stats` as `plugin:git-glance`)".

## 3. Grants

The grants live in `cox-store`, the only crate with SQL (D9). Migration `00000000000004_plugins` follows `…001_init`, `…002_usage_effort` and `…003_checkpoints`. Two Diesel tables, with typed models like `UsageDbRow` (`crates/cox-store/src/models.rs:29`):

| Table | Columns | Key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `plugin_grants` | `plugin_id`, `scope` (`user` or `project:<root>`), `digest`, `capabilities` (JSON of the granted list), `enabled`, `source` (JSON), `decided_at` | (`plugin_id`, `scope`, `digest`) |
| `plugin_kv` | `plugin_id`, `key`, `value` (blob), `updated_at` | (`plugin_id`, `key`) |

There is no general kv table today (`schema.rs:13-87`). A narrow `PluginStore` trait sits in `cox-protocol` next to `Store` (`grant_get`, `grant_put`, `grant_set_enabled`, `grants_delete`, `kv_get`, `kv_put`, `kv_delete_all`), so `Store` itself does not grow. Quota: 64 KiB per value and 1 MiB per plugin. extism's own vars are switched off (`max_var_bytes = 0`, P12), so kv is the only state that outlives a call. It is persistent, has a quota, and is deleted by `remove`.

`grant::check(manifest, digest, stored) -> Verdict` is a pure function in `cox-plugin`, with three results:

- `Granted`: the digest matches and the requested capabilities are a subset of the granted ones. Asking for fewer never re-asks.
- `NeedsApproval { added, removed }`: a new digest, or wider capabilities.
- `Disabled`.

The granted list (T33.6) is a sorted JSON array of strings, one line per capability: `events:<tag>`, `hooks:<name>`, `tools:<name>`, `invoke:<name>`, `net:<host>`, `fs.read:<root>`, `fs.write:<root>`, `decide:<point>`, `ui.render:<target>`, the flags `wasi`, `context`, `kv`, `ui.status`, `ui.panel`, `ui.overlay`, `ui.commands`, `ui.keys`, `model:cheap` or `model:code`, plus one line per `[[provider]]` (`provider:<name> <base_url> key=<env>`), `[[mcp]]` (`mcp:<name> <command args | url>`) and `[[external_agents]]` entry. The model tier is the one ordered entry: a `model:code` grant covers a `model:cheap` request. A row whose `capabilities` is not such an array grants nothing, and a store read error counts as no grant. `Disabled` wins over the digest check. A project `.cox/config.toml` may turn `plugins.enabled` off but never on (the project-config guard list).

By surface:

- **TUI.** At session open, each `NeedsApproval` plugin gets a `Modal::PluginGrant`. The TUI has one modal slot (`crates/cox-tui/src/state.rs:114-135`), so the dialogs queue. It lists the capabilities in words and, for project plugins, the repository in warning style. The keys are `y` (grant) and `n` (skip for this session). There is no "always" key: a grant is always per digest.
- **Headless `run -p` and ACP.** Only `Granted` plugins load. Anything else is one `Notice(Warn)` naming the command to run. This matches headless approval, which denies when there is no approver (`crates/cox/src/run.rs:331`).
- **CLI.** `enable` and `install` prompt on stdin, and `--yes` accepts.

## 4. Host↔guest ABI (`api = 1`)

Every payload is JSON through extism's `Json<T>` conversion. The types sit in `cox-plugin-api` with `JsonSchema`, `cox-protocol` re-exports them as `cox_protocol::plugin`, and the committed `docs/plugin-abi.schema.json` has a drift test. Existing protocol types cross the ABI unchanged: `Event` (`types.rs:775`), `HookEvent`/`HookOutcome` (`types.rs:275,572`), `ToolSpec` (`types.rs:1183`), `ToolOutput` (`types.rs:1200`), `Request`/`ProviderEvent`/`Usage`. They already derive `JsonSchema` (`types.rs:14`).

**Guest exports.** Only `cox_init` is required. The rest are probed with `function_exists` (P8).

| Export | In → out | Called |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cox_init` | `InitIn { api, plugin_id, config: Value, session: SessionInfo, granted }` → `InitOut { tools: Vec<ToolSpec>, commands, keys, status, panels, renderers, subscribe }` | once per session; anything not granted is dropped with a notice |
| `cox_on_event` | `EventBatch { first_seq, dropped, events }` → `Effects { redraw, notices }` | §5 |
| `cox_hook` | `HookCall { event, payload }` → `HookOutcome` | §6 |
| `cox_decide` | `Question` → `DecideOut { Advice(Option<Advice>) \| Call(ModelCall) }` | §6b; `ModelCall.target = Tier(t) \| OwnProvider { name, model }` (2026-09-26, T33.40.1) |
| `cox_decide_resume` (optional) | `DecideResume { question, events }` → `Option<Advice>` | §6b; called after the host runs a `Call`'s `ModelCall` through the plugin's own provider, budget-gated and ledgered (2026-09-26, T33.40.1) |
| `cox_tool_subject` / `cox_tool_risk` / `cox_tool_call` | the `Tool` trait, serialised (`traits.rs:212-234`) | §7 |
| `cox_provider_stream` | `ProviderCall { request: Request, model }` → `Vec<ProviderEvent>` | §7a |
| `cox_command` / `cox_key` | `CommandIn { name, args }` → `CommandOut` | §8 |
| `cox_render` | `RenderIn { slot, width, height }` → `Widget` | §8 |
| `cox_render_item` | `RenderItemIn { target, call, result, width }` → `Option<Widget>` | §8 |
| `cox_shutdown` | `()` → `()` | session end, best effort |

`CommandOut` is deliberately narrow: `Prompt { text }` (submitted as `UserTurn`, like a markdown command), `Compact { focus }`, `TogglePanel`, `OpenOverlay`, `Notice`, or nothing. A plugin can never send an arbitrary `Submission`. `SetPermissionMode(bypass)`, `Approve` and `SwitchModel` up are out of reach.

**Host functions** live in namespace `cox:host/v1` and are registered with `with_function_in_namespace` (P7). Each call checks the grant and the calling context.

| Host fn | Capability | Allowed from | What it goes through |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cox_log(level, text)` | — | all | `tracing` only; rate-limited |
| `cox_notify(level, text)` | — | all but render | `Event::Notice`; the level is capped at `Warn` (a plugin can never raise `Security` or `Budget`); sanitized when shown |
| `cox_kv_get/put/delete` | `kv` | all but render | `PluginStore`, quota |
| `cox_context()` | `context` | all | the host's event-folded snapshot (§5) |
| `cox_invoke_tool(name, input)` | `invoke` lists the name | `on_event`, `command`, `key`, `tool_call` | builds a `ToolCall` and runs `PreToolUse` → `Engine::decide` (`permission/mod.rs:106`) → sandbox → archive, like a model call; `Ask` shows "plugin <id> asks to run …" in the TUI and is denied in headless mode (`run.rs:331`) |
| `cox_model_call(ModelCall)` | `model` | all but render | router → provider registry with `Job::Plugin(id)` at or below the granted tier: budget gate first, then one `usage` row (§7d) |
| `cox_http(HttpReq)` to a `net`-listed host | `net` | all but render | host-side reqwest; host must match the allow-list; body cap `max_http_response_bytes` |
| `cox_http(HttpReq)` to a provider section's `base_url` host | that `[[provider]]` section | `cox_provider_stream` only (2026-09-26; `NotInThisContext` everywhere else, including `cox_decide`) | host-side reqwest; the host injects the provider's auth header (§7a); the only path a decision plugin may reach its own paid provider from (T33.40.1) |
| `cox_output(line)` / `cox_cancelled()` | inside `tool_call` | `tool_call` | `ToolCx.output` / `ToolCx.cancel` (`traits.rs:187`) |
| `cox_redraw()` | any `ui` | all | marks the plugin's slots dirty (§8) |

Configuration comes in `InitIn.config`. That is the plugin's `[plugins.<id>]` table from `Config`, which gains `plugins: PluginsConfig { enabled, decide, #[serde(flatten)] entries }`, the same flatten pattern as `HooksConfig` and `McpConfig` (`config.rs:844,876`). The plugin validates its own table.

**Why some calls are banned in some contexts.** The core awaits `cox_hook`, `cox_decide` and `cox_provider_stream`. A tool invocation from inside them would need the loop that is waiting on them, which is a deadlock. So those contexts get `Err(NotInThisContext)`. `cox_render` has a strict time cap, so it may only read. The same reasoning gates `cox_http` to a provider host: reaching it from inside `cox_decide` directly would either deadlock (the plugin's own worker is blocked waiting on `cox_decide`, P8) or bypass the budget gate and the ledger, so the host allows it only inside `cox_provider_stream`. A decision plugin reaches its own provider instead by returning `DecideOut::Call(ModelCall)`, which the host runs before calling `cox_decide_resume` (2026-09-26, T33.40.1, R§4.3.6 J§4).

**Versioning.** `api` is the ABI major. A minor addition (a new optional export, host function or field) keeps `api = 1`, because unknown JSON fields are ignored in both directions. A breaking change raises the major. The host supports the current major and the previous one for one minor release of cox, and `cox plugin list` flags plugins on the old major.

**Threading.** One OS thread per plugin owns its `Plugin` (`call` is `&mut self`, P8) and serves two bounded queues:

- *control*: hooks, decide, tools, provider, render and commands; depth 16, served first;
- *events*: a ring of depth 256 (§5).

Each call runs under its own deadline through a `CancelHandle` timer (P9). The manifest `timeout_ms` is set to the plugin's `limits.call_ms` as the outer cap (P13). Calls into one plugin run one at a time, so its tools carry `Concurrency::Exclusive`. Different plugins run in parallel. `Pool` (P10) is not used, because extra instances would split plugin state.

### Decision points for a decision model such as Jev

A decision plugin (A25/P21; Jev is the first) needs to *answer* questions the core asks, not only intercept them. That is `cox_decide` behind a new `Advisor` trait in `cox-protocol`, set on `Session` like `set_hook` (`crates/cox-core/src/session.rs:469`). The core still decides. It offers the options, applies a monotone rule, and uses the local default on silence, lateness or low confidence.

| Point | Where in the core today | Question | Rule the core enforces |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `route` | `router::pick`, `Job::Main` only, once per `UserTurn` | Choice among tiers ≤ the static pick | never up, never `think` (D5); opt-in per session config; the core offers a downgrade only when its own cost estimate predicts a saving over the static pick (2026-09-26, T33.40.8) |
| `risk` | after the classifier, before `Engine::decide` (`turn.rs:244-259`) | Score of severity | may raise `Risk`, never lower it; asked only when raising to `Destructive` would change the engine's outcome (2026-09-26, T33.40.6) |
| `approve_hint` | approval modal | Noul, a caution note only | warning-only: may add "caution", never say a call "looks safe" — monotone the same direction as `risk` (2026-09-26, §14 decision 10; bare "looks safe" display is unsafe against a steered state, R§4.3.6 J12) |
| `compact` | after `TurnDone`, before the threshold check | Noul "compact now?" | may only compact earlier; never skips a mandatory compaction |
| `rank` | `tool_search`, skill match | Choice or reject over candidates cox found | reorders or filters; never adds |
| `salience` | memory extraction | Score per item | thresholds stay in config |

`[plugins.decide]` names exactly one plugin per point (`route = "jev"`), with `min_confidence` and a latency budget (defaults: route 300 ms, risk 200 ms, compact 500 ms, rank 300 ms). Without an entry the point is off. A new `Event::Advised { point, plugin, advice, applied }` records every answer, so replay and `cox stats` can see which ones were used. A model call inside `cox_decide` is an ordinary `cox_model_call` with its own ledger row.

These points are not a `HookEvent`, on purpose. A hook's `Modify` rewrites input and has no monotone rule, so a hook-shaped router could route up.

`Question` carries `items: Vec<QuestionItem>`, so one request covers every item a point needs in one tool batch or one turn instead of one request per item — 12× cheaper and 10× faster for a 13-item batch, measured against System One's own batching cookbook (2026-09-26, T33.40.1, R§4.3.6 J10).

## 5. Events

**The tap.** `cox-protocol` gains `trait EventTap: Send + Sync { fn offer(&self, seq: u64, ev: &Event); }`, which must not block. `Session::emit` calls it right after the rollout append, with the same scrubbed event the rollout gets (`crates/cox-core/src/session.rs:419-450`, scrub at 431). Plugins therefore see redacted events, in rollout order, from one place for all four surfaces. `Session::events()` has exactly one consumer (`session.rs:406-408`), so tapping a surface's consumer would have meant three copies of the tap.

**Delivery.** Each plugin gets the `Event` variants named in `capabilities.events`, as read-only JSON copies. That is any of the 21 variants at `types.rs:775`. `text_delta`, `thinking_delta` and `tool_call_output` are allowed but arrive batched.

**Queue.** `offer` pushes into the plugin's ring of 256 under a short lock and returns. When the ring is full it drops the *oldest* event and increments `dropped`. The next `EventBatch` carries `first_seq` and `dropped`, so the plugin knows about the gap. Recent state matters more to a status segment than history. Order within one plugin is emission order. Nothing is ordered across plugins.

**Never blocking.** The core loop's cost per event per plugin is one `try_lock` and one push. A slow plugin loses events. It never slows a turn.

**The context snapshot** (`cox_context`) is folded by the host from the same tap. It holds the session id, cwd, tier and model, usage totals, the last 50 items with assembled text (redacted), the todo list and compactions. It is not the assembled `Request` (§12).

## 6. Hooks

Plugin hooks are one more hook source, with no second mechanism.

- `PluginHooks` implements `cox_protocol::Hook` (`traits.rs:349`) with the same `HookOutcome` model: Continue, Block, Modify, Failed.
- A `HookChain(Vec<Arc<dyn Hook>>)` replaces the single wrapped `ShellHooks` (`crates/cox/src/session.rs:150-165`). The chaining loop moves out of `ShellHooks::run` (`crates/cox-ext/src/hooks.rs:37-73`) into one shared function: the first `Block` or `Failed` stops the chain, and a `Modify` feeds its `tool_input` to the next hook. `PresenceHook` keeps wrapping the chain (`presence.rs:159,234`).
- **Order.** Config shell hooks run first, so the user's own rules win. Plugin hooks follow in plugin-id order.
- **Dispatch fix.** `fire_configured` today dispatches only events present in `[hooks]` (`crates/cox-core/src/hooks.rs:17-25`), so a plugin hook would never run. `Hook` gains `fn interested(&self, event: HookEvent) -> bool`, defaulting to the config check. The chain answers true when any source is interested.
- **Timeout.** A plugin hook's deadline is the smaller of `hooks.timeout_s` and `limits.call_ms`. When the deadline passes, the host cancels the call and returns `Failed`. The core then fails open (`hooks.rs:70-83`).
- **Safety of `Modify`.** A plugin's `Modify` on `PreToolUse` cannot get past the engine, because `PreToolUse` runs before `Engine::decide` (`turn.rs:244-259`).

## 7. Tools, providers, models, MCP

**Tools.** Each granted tool is a `WasmTool` implementing `Tool`, named `wasm__<id>__<tool>` as in the earlier sketch (`v0.2-wasm.md`).

- It is always `deferred: true`, so it reaches the model only through `tool_search`.
- Its `ToolSpec` is taken from `cox_init` once and frozen for the session.
- Specs are sorted by (plugin id, tool name) and appended after MCP tools (`crates/cox/src/session.rs:122-124`).
- Discovered tools join `Request.tools` in discovery order after the stable set (`crates/cox-core/src/context.rs:58-62,92`), so the prefix changes once per discovery, as it does for MCP.
- A plugin that returns different specs on its next `init` changes the next session, never the current one.
- Output goes through the normal path: the core archives before it truncates (D6a).

**7a. Providers.** Two forms, both recommended.

- **Declarative (`api = "chat" | "responses"`).** The section merges into `providers.custom` as one more `CompatibleProviderConfig` (`config.rs:560`), and cox drives it with its own wire clients. There is no wasm on the request path. A user config section with the same name wins, and the plugin's section is skipped with a notice. This is the zero-code path for any OpenAI-shaped endpoint.
- **ABI (`api = "plugin"`).** A `PluginProvider` implements `Provider`: `stream()` calls `cox_provider_stream` with the provider-neutral `Request` and forwards the returned `ProviderEvent`s. It exists for wires none of cox's clients parse, such as Jev's System One (`crates/cox-provider/src/jev.rs:8-13`).
  - The guest reaches the network only through `cox_http`, only to `base_url`'s host.
  - The **host** resolves the key with `resolve_key(api_key_env, <section>)` (`crates/cox-provider/src/http.rs:49`) and adds it as the declared `auth` header. The key never enters wasm memory, and the plugin never sees the keyring.
  - v1 returns one batch per request. Streaming through a `cox_emit` host function is a later minor addition.

For both forms:

- The core writes one `usage` row per request and checks the budget before it, as for any provider (invariant 8).
- The price comes from the catalog, never from the plugin.
- A plugin's `Usage` is untrusted. If it is missing, cox estimates (`estimated: true`). If the reported input is below half of cox's own token estimate for the request, cox records the estimate and warns once.

**7b. Models.** `[[models]]` rows join the `cox-models` catalog as a new layer. Today the order is built-in < config < user `prices.toml` (`crates/cox-models/src/catalog.rs:119-198`). It becomes: **built-in < plugin < config < user prices**.

- The plugin layer only *fills*. For an id the built-in rows already have, a plugin may set only fields that are still `None`. A conflicting value, above all a price, is ignored with a `Notice(Warn)` and a `cox doctor` row: "plugin jev tried to change the price of claude-haiku-4-5".
- For a new id the plugin row is taken whole. If two plugins define the same new id, the lower plugin id wins and the other gets a warning.
- `Catalog::load` takes the plugin rows as an argument, so `cox-models` stays pure. `ModelRow` gains a `source` field for `cox doctor`.

**7c. MCP servers.** `[[mcp]]` entries join `cox_mcp::discovery::discover` (`crates/cox-mcp/src/discovery.rs:22`) as one more source (`sources["<id>-<name>"] = "plugin:<id>"`), with the lowest precedence: `.mcp.json`, `~/.claude.json` and config all win on a name clash. Tools appear as `mcp__<id>-<name>__<tool>`.

- **A stdio server must be a real process.** rmcp's stdio transport speaks to a child process (`crates/cox-mcp/src/client.rs:91-100`), and a wasm plugin that wants tools already has the in-process `tools` capability, which is cheaper.
- A command inside the package is covered by the digest. A PATH program (`npx`, `uvx`) is shown verbatim at approval.
- `crates/cox` wraps the argv with the platform sandbox (`sandbox::Policy`, `cox-sandbox` after T32.3) before `cox-mcp` spawns it, so `cox-mcp` keeps depending on `cox-protocol` only. `client.rs:92` already clears the environment.
- **Every MCP stdio server is sandboxed, not only a plugin's (resolved 2026-09-26, §14 decision 4).** `client.rs:91-98`'s existing, user-configured servers get the same `sandbox::Policy` wrap as a plugin's, with a per-server `sandbox = false` opt-out in config for setups that need it (T33.42 — its own card, so this behaviour change does not ride in on T33.19's landing).
- An HTTP `url` needs its host in `net`.

**7d. Model calls by plugins.** A plugin that wants a model answer, for example a hook asking Jev, uses `cox_model_call`, never raw HTTP to a provider:

- the router picks from the granted tier, which is at most `cheap` unless `code` is granted, and never `think` (D5);
- the budget gate runs, and one `usage` row is written with `job = plugin:<id>` (D5: "every request carries a job tag");
- the key stays in the host.

Raw `cox_http` to a paid API would bypass the ledger and the budget, and would need the key inside the guest. Manifest validation therefore refuses a `net` entry that matches the host of any configured provider section. Talking to a provider goes through a provider section or `cox_model_call`.

## 8. TUI contributions

**Widget tree** (`cox-plugin-api::ui`). It is declarative and closed:

- `Widget = Text(Vec<Line>) | List { items, selected } | Table { header, rows, widths } | KeyValue(Vec<(Span, Vec<Span>)>) | Gauge { ratio, label } | Stack { vertical, children, sizes } | Block { title, child }`
- `Span { text, style: StyleToken, bold, italic }`
- `StyleToken` names the `Theme` fields (`crates/cox-render/src/theme.rs:29-46`: `text`, `dim`, `accent`, `ok`, `warn`, `error`, `diff_add`, `diff_del`, `border`, `selection`, …). Plugins get no raw colours, so themes, `NO_COLOR` and colour downgrade keep working.
- Limits: at most 512 nodes, depth 8 and 16 KiB of text per render. Anything over the limit becomes a one-line "plugin output too large".
- The conversion to ratatui lives in `cox-tui` and runs every string through `cox_sanitize::sanitize_with` (`crates/cox-sanitize/src/lib.rs:27`), the same boundary as `cells::cell_lines` (`cells.rs:100-101`).

**Slots.**

| Slot | Where | Budget |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status.left`, `status.right` | the one status row (`status.rs:1-8`) | ≤ 24 columns per segment; plugin segments drop first on a narrow terminal |
| `panel` | rows above the composer, like the todo panel | ≤ 8 rows; toggled by the plugin's command or key |
| `overlay` | `Modal::Plugin { id }`, full screen like `Modal::Diff` and `Modal::Transcript` | Esc closes |

There is no sidebar. D10's inline viewport has no side area. A sidebar would need the alternate screen (§12).

**Renderers.** A `ui.render` target is `tool:<name>` or `item:assistant_message`. When a `Cell::Tool` completes (`ToolCallDone`), the TUI asks the matching renderer once and caches the result in the cell. `None`, a timeout or an error falls back to the built-in rendering (`cells.rs:87-193`). The model-visible text and the archive are never touched, and headless, ACP and the rollout never see renderer output.

**Commands.** Plugin commands appear in the palette as `/<id>:<name>` with the plugin as their source. They are appended to `State.commands` after the built-ins (`state.rs:189-191`) and dispatched like file commands (`state.rs:1217,1395-1408`), so a built-in always wins.

**Keys.** Plugin keys are reachable only as `<leader> <key>`. The leader is the new keymap action `plugin.leader`, rebindable in `keybindings.toml` (`keymap.rs:308`). Built-in and user bindings always win. A clash between two plugins goes to the lower id and is reported by `Keymap::conflicts()` (`keymap.rs:278`).

**Redraw model (Zellij's, P18).** `view` never calls a plugin. `cox_render` runs only when:

- the plugin asked through `Effects.redraw` or `cox_redraw()`;
- a resize happened;
- a slot became visible.

The result is cached in `State` through `Msg::Plugin(PluginUiMsg)`, and `Cmd::Plugin(PluginRequest)` carries commands, keys and slot sizes back to the host. This fits `update(&mut State, Msg) -> Vec<Cmd>` (`state.rs:364,643`) and the draw-per-`Msg` loop (`crates/cox-tui/src/app.rs:151`). A render has 20 ms. Past that, the last good render stays on screen, and three misses in a row show "⚠ <id> slow" and stop the slot for the session. `cox-tui` depends only on the ABI types through `cox-protocol`, never on `cox-plugin`.

Headless and ACP do not call UI exports.

## 9. Where the code lives

| Crate | Rule (`crates.md`) | Depends on | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cox-plugin-api` | (d): the guest SDK needs the ABI and manifest types without `cox-protocol`'s tokio and `CancellationToken` (`crates/cox-protocol/Cargo.toml`) | serde, serde_json, schemars | manifest, ABI payloads, widget tree, capability names; builds for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` |
| `cox-plugin` | (a): the only user of extism and wasmtime | protocol, plugin-api, sanitize | loader, digest, grant check, workers, host fns, `PluginHooks`, `WasmTool`, `PluginProvider`, `EventTap`, `Advisor` impls |
| `plugins/` (separate cargo workspace, not `crates/*`) | guest code must never build for the host in `cargo nextest run --workspace` | extism-pdk 1.4.1 | `sdk/` (`cox-plugin-sdk`), `examples/<lang>/`, `templates/<lang>/` |

`cox-protocol` re-exports `cox_plugin_api` as `cox_protocol::plugin`, so every type that crosses a crate boundary is still reachable from the protocol crate. New `deps.rs` rules follow `only_store_depends_on_diesel` (`crates/cox/tests/deps.rs:85-99`):

- only `cox-plugin` depends on `extism`;
- `cox-plugin-api` depends on no workspace crate;
- `cox-core` does not depend on `cox-plugin`.

`extism::Error` is anyhow (P6), and `cox-plugin` maps it to its own `thiserror` enum `PluginError` at the boundary.

## 10. Security

- **Resources.**
  - Memory: `limits.memory_mib`, host max 64 MiB.
  - Per-call deadlines: render 20 ms, event batch 50 ms, hook ≤ `hooks.timeout_s`, tool ≤ the tool timeout, decide ≤ its point budget.
  - Queue depths as in §4, a kv quota, and vars off.
  - No fuel metering: epoch interruption (P13) is cheaper and enough.
- **Filesystem.** Only WASI preopens from `fs`. Each root passes `cox_tools::path::confine` at load. `.git` and `.cox` are never writable (D7), and read grants mount `ro:` (P11). WASI is on only when `wasi = true` or `fs` is set. The `WasiCtx` has no environment and no arguments (P16).
- **Network.** Only `cox_http`, only to allow-listed hosts, capped by `max_http_response_bytes`. extism's own `http_request` is compiled out (P5), and a test proves it refuses.
- **No bypass.** No host function spawns a process, opens a file, writes the terminal, reads the keyring or decides a permission. MCP stdio servers (§7c) and external-agent CLI processes (`[[external_agents]]`, P35, `docs/design/external-agents.md`) are the only processes a plugin brings, and both run under the same sandbox wrap, spawned by the host, never by a WASM guest.
- **Untrusted output.** Everything a plugin returns is untrusted like MCP output: tool descriptions and results go to the model through the normal archive and truncate path, and everything shown in the terminal is sanitized.
- **Fail open (D14).**
  - A load failure, a trap, a timeout or invalid JSON is `Notice(Warn)` plus absence.
  - Three failures in a row disable that export for the session.
  - `cox doctor` gains a plugins row: loaded, skipped, not granted, disabled exports and their reasons. `cox ext list` shows the same state, so "my plugin stopped working" always leaves a visible trace (`extensions.md` falsifier 2).

## 11. Performance budget and how it is measured

| Metric | Budget | Measured by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| release binary growth from extism and wasmtime | ≤ 22 MiB (was 20 MiB, and 10 MiB before that; T33.3 measured +16.8 MiB on 2026-09-26, and the whole `plugins` feature measured +20.38 MiB on 2026-09-27, A65) | `scripts/footprint.sh` before and after T33.3 (R§4.3.5 P25) |
| clean build growth | ≤ 60 s | `cargo build --timings` before and after T33.3 (R§4.3.5 P25) |
| warm session start per plugin (wasmtime cache on) | ≤ 50 ms | `just bench` timing over the Rust example: open, then `cox_init` |
| cold compile of a 1 MiB module | ≤ 500 ms | same, cache cleared |
| `cox_on_event` batch of 16 | p50 ≤ 1 ms | same, 1 000 calls |
| `cox_render` of a status segment | p95 ≤ 5 ms | same |
| hook round trip | p95 ≤ 5 ms (a shell hook is tens of ms, `extensions.md`) | same |

The compilation cache uses `with_cache_config` (P7), pointed at `~/.cox/cache/wasmtime/`.

## 12. Falsifiers and out of scope

**Falsifiers.**

1. **Footprint.** If T33.3 measures more than 10 MiB of binary or 60 s of clean build for extism, the host moves behind a default-on cargo feature `plugins`, a lean build ships without it, and D1 is amended. **Fired (2026-09-26).** T33.3 measured +16.8 MiB (53 713 168 → 71 277 728 B, R§4.3.5 P25); clean-build growth could not be separated from machine load (wall time 159 s before, 139 s after; +463 CPU-s of new units). The creator's decision: the host sits behind the cargo feature `plugins` on `crates/cox`, on by default, which gates the optional `cox-plugin` dependency. The slim build is `--no-default-features --features otel`, and `crates/cox/tests/deps.rs` (`slim_build_has_no_wasm_runtime`) checks that it has no extism or wasmtime. The binary budget became 20 MiB. On 2026-09-27 the whole `plugins` feature measured +20.38 MiB (77 780 912 B full against 56 409 008 B slim, macOS arm64 release), and the creator raised the budget to 22 MiB (A65); the falsifier fires again above that.
2. **Latency.** If warm start exceeds 50 ms per plugin or a status render exceeds 5 ms p95 on the example, status segments become push-only: a `cox_set_status` host function replaces `cox_render` for the status slot.
3. **The ABI is too small.** If Jev-as-a-plugin (T33.40) needs a host function that bypasses the engine, the ledger or the sandbox, the ABI is wrong and the decision-point design is revisited before `api = 1` freezes.
4. **The wasmtime pin.** If a wasmtime advisory affects the version extism pins (43, P3) and extism ships no fix within 30 days, embedding wasmtime directly is re-evaluated.
5. **Context access.** If three plugin requests need the assembled `Request` (the system prompt and instruction files) and the event-folded snapshot cannot serve them, a read-only `cox_request_view` is designed. It must not break the cache-stable prefix.

**Out of scope.**

- A marketplace or registry.
- Install from a URL (with a sha256) or from git (with a tag).
- Signatures.
- The component model and WIT.
- Plugin-to-plugin calls.
- Plugins adding text to the system prompt (skills do that).
- A sidebar in the inline viewport.
- Changing tool schemas within a running session.
- Loading Claude Code plugin bundles as cox plugins.
- JS, Python, C# and other PDKs.

## 13. Scaffolding and languages

**`cox plugin new <name> [--lang rust|go|kotlin|dart] [--dir <path>] [--with status,panel,command,key,renderer,hook,event,tool,provider,models,mcp]`**

- One pure module, `crates/cox/src/plugin_new.rs`, maps (name, lang, with) to a list of (path, content). The CLI writes that list. The TUI palette's `/plugin new` reaches the same function through `Cmd`, and asks for the language with the existing `Modal::Picker` when `--lang` is missing. Headless defaults to `rust`.
- The name is validated as a plugin id. An existing target directory is an error, never an overwrite.
- The output is:
  - `plugin.toml`, whose `[capabilities]` match `--with` exactly;
  - stub exports only for the chosen capabilities;
  - a build recipe (a `justfile`);
  - a `README.md`;
  - a smoke test that installs the built package into a scratch `COX_HOME` with `--yes` and checks that `cox plugin list --json` reports it `loaded` with the chosen contributions. `list` compiles each granted plugin and runs `cox_init` against a stub session.
- Templates live in `plugins/templates/<lang>/` with `.tmpl` names, so cargo, go and gradle never pick them up. They are embedded with `include_str!` in one table, which needs no new dependency. Capability blocks are marked `cox:with=<cap>` … `cox:end` and removed when not chosen.

**Dev loop.** `cox plugin link <dir>` (optional card) uses a built plugin in place. A linked plugin asks again only when its capabilities widen, never on byte changes, because the user builds it. It is marked `dev` in every listing and in `cox doctor`. `/plugin reload` is the same as `/clear` (§1b). `cox plugin build` is not needed, because the template's `justfile` is the build. `cox plugin dev` (watch, rebuild and reload) is not needed either, because `link` plus `/plugin reload` covers it.

**Languages (sources R§4.3.5 P26–P37).**

| Lang | PDK | Target | Loads in extism today? | Plan |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rust | `extism-pdk` 1.4.1, official | `wasm32-unknown-unknown` | yes (P17) | the reference: SDK, example and template first |
| Go | `github.com/extism/go-pdk` v1.1.3, official (maintained, pushed 2026-01-22) | TinyGo `-target wasip1 -buildmode=c-shared`, or Go ≥ 1.24 `GOOS=wasip1` with `//go:wasmexport` | yes by the PDK's docs, with WASI on | SDK wrapper, example and template, built in the `plugins` CI job |
| Kotlin | none maintained (`LizAinslie/extism-kotlin-pdk`, last push 2023-11-30) | Kotlin/Wasm `wasmWasi`, Beta, WASI preview 1, needs GC and exception handling; `@WasmImport`/`@WasmExport` are experimental | **refuted (T33.35, 2026-09-26, R§4.3.5 P40–P43)**: a minimal `cox_init` module (Kotlin 2.4.20) fails to *parse* under extism 1.30.0's default engine config — `exceptions proposal not enabled` — regardless of WASI; Kotlin's `wasmWasi` output unconditionally uses the wasm exception-handling proposal, which extism enables only behind its non-default `wasmtime-exceptions` feature. With that feature on it instantiates and calls `cox_init` cleanly, with WASI off exactly as the real host runs today (A55/T33.43 is not the blocker here) | `wasmtime-exceptions` approved and on (A61), but any real module also imports `wasi_snapshot_preview1::random_get` from Kotlin's stdlib (R§4.3.5 P45), so Kotlin waits for WASI (T33.43, A63); the draft PDK and example are on branch `wip/t33.36-kotlin` |
| Dart | none | `dart2wasm` targets JS environments only: "doesn't support execution in standard Wasm run-times like wasmtime" (dart.dev, Dart 3.13) | **no — refuted again 2026-09-26** (T33.37, R§4.3.5 P44): Dart 3.13.4's `dart compile wasm` still emits a JS bootstrap, and the module fails to parse under the workspace's pinned extism/wasmtime 43 (`exceptions proposal not enabled`) before even reaching its `wasm:js-string`/`dart2wasm` JS imports | documented exception: the Dart template scaffolds a plugin whose only capability is an `[[mcp]]` stdio server (`dart compile exe`, `dart_mcp` 0.5.2), so `--with` accepts only `tool` and `mcp` for Dart; dart-lang/sdk#56366 (WASI support) is still open — re-run the spike when it closes |

Every language implements the same example: a status segment showing the turn count, a `PostToolUse` hook that counts failures, a `/<id>:reset` command and a `turn_started` subscription. The Dart MCP variant implements one tool, `count`.

**Building examples and templates.**

- The Rust example is built by `crates/cox-plugin-fixtures/build.rs` into `OUT_DIR`. The target comes from `mise.toml` (`rust = { version = "1.97.1", targets = ["wasm32-unknown-unknown"] }`, P22) and CI's `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` `targets:` input (P23). It needs no network once the registry cache is warm, like any other dependency. No `.wasm` is committed, so nothing drifts from its source and A48 is untouched.
- Host unit tests use inline WAT (P15), with no build at all.
- Go, Kotlin and Dart toolchains go in `plugins/mise.toml` (mise reads per-directory config), so host-only contributors never install them. Their e2e tests are `#[ignore = "needs <toolchain>: run `just plugin-examples <lang>`"]`: nextest lists them as skipped with the reason, never as passed. A `plugin-examples` CI job installs the toolchains and runs `--run-ignored only`. In that job a missing toolchain is a failure.

## 14. Decisions (2026-09-26)

The creator resolved every open question this design and the Jev use case (A25/A52, T33.40) raised. Recorded here so a later reader does not re-litigate them; each is cross-referenced from where it changes the design above.

1. **SDK/API publishing.** `cox-plugin-api` and `cox-plugin-sdk` are not published while `api` may still change. Publishing them, once the ABI is stable, is a `roadmap.md` item, not a P33 card.
2. **Dart.** Stays the documented exception (§13): its only v1 capability is an `[[mcp]]` stdio server. T33.37 re-checked dart-lang/sdk#56366 on 2026-09-26 (still open) and tried Dart 3.13.4 against the workspace's extism/wasmtime pins (R§4.3.5 P44): refuted — `dart compile wasm` still emits a JS bootstrap, and the module fails to instantiate (`exceptions proposal not enabled`) before its `wasm:js-string`/`dart2wasm` JS imports even come into play. Re-run the spike when #56366 closes.
3. **Kotlin.** T33.35's spike (2026-09-26, R§4.3.5 P40–P43) found that a minimal Kotlin/Wasm `wasmWasi` module needs extism's non-default `wasmtime-exceptions` feature just to parse (unrelated to WASI/A55). The creator approved turning it on for the whole workspace on 2026-09-26 (A61), so it applies to every plugin, not only Kotlin ones; see "Engine features" in `docs/plugins.md`. A real Kotlin module also imports `wasi_snapshot_preview1::random_get` from Kotlin's own stdlib (R§4.3.5 P45), and the host keeps WASI off until T33.43 (A55), so T33.36 waits for that bump, like Go (A63).
4. **Sandboxing MCP stdio servers.** Every MCP stdio server — not only ones a plugin ships — runs under `sandbox::Policy` (§7c). This resolves §7c's open question the other way from the status quo: instead of leaving existing user-configured servers unsandboxed, it wraps all of them, with a per-server opt-out in config (T33.42, its own card).
5. **`route`.** A plugin may only downgrade the tier (D5 still holds: never up, never `think`). The core offers a downgrade to the plugin only when its own cost estimate (catalog prices, prefix size, the cache-read/write formula, T33.40.8) predicts a saving over the static pick. A plugin cannot even be asked when the core's own estimate says downgrading would cost more.
6. **Install sources in v1.** Confirmed: local folder only (§1). Git and URL sources move to `roadmap.md`.
7. **CI.** A separate `plugin-examples` job builds go, tinygo, java, gradle, kotlin and dart (§13) rather than folding them into the main job.
8. **The built-in `typesafe` section.** Once the Jev plugin (T33.40) reaches parity, the built-in `[providers.typesafe]` client (`crates/cox-provider/src/jev.rs`) is removed from the core, per the Jev cards' tombstone config type, fail-open notice and removal cards (T33.40.12–T33.40.16). Until parity, both exist side by side (T33.40.5).
9. **Jev evals.** Only E1 (`risk`, Jev only, capped at $0.10, T33.40.7) is approved to run. E2 (`route`, real Anthropic plus Jev, capped at $3, T33.40.10) stays in the plan but needs the creator's explicit go-ahead before each run.
10. **`approve_hint`.** Warnings only. A plugin may add "caution"; it may never say "looks safe" — the same monotone shape as `risk`, just never usable to grant quiet approval (§4's decision-points table, above).
11. **`risk` advisor.** Enabled only by an explicit line in `[plugins.decide]` — never automatically on install, even after E1 passes. The grant dialog states exactly what data leaves the machine for that point.
12. **T32.15 (`cox-provider-jev`) is dropped.** After parity, `jev.rs` is deleted outright rather than extracted into its own crate; see `plan.md` §6 A52 and `done.md`.
13. **The ABI fix from the Jev research.** Writing the Jev plugin against `api = 1` as first drafted exposed a deadlock/ledger-bypass gap (T33.40.1, §4 above): `cox_decide` now returns either an `Advice` or a `ModelCall`, the host runs the call through the plugin's own provider with the budget gate and ledger, then calls `cox_decide_resume`; `cox_http` to a provider host is allowed only inside `cox_provider_stream`; `Question` is batched. The example provider throughout this document is named `typesafe`, not `jev` — the plugin id stays `jev`, the provider section it declares is `typesafe` (§2).
14. **No prebuilt Jev plugin archive ships with the release.** Users build it from `plugins/jev` (`just plugin jev`) and install it with `cox plugin install <dir>` (§1).
